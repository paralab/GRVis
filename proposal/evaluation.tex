For phase 1 of the project, we will submit the python script that, in parallel, generates a set of animatinos from collections of \texttt{.pvtu} files for each time step. In addition, a selection of the rendered animations will be submitted with a written comparison of the differences between ParaView and VTK parallel rendering.

Then for phase 2, when an advanced topic has been decided upon, the final report will include a detailed writeup of what we learned during the implementation of the C++ pipeline and the advanced topic. This submission will include the C++ program that incorporates what we learned from the python script and any new rendered animations that arise from implementing the advanced topic. The final report will then also include a comparison of the python and C++ implementations.
