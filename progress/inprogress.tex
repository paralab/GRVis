In order to complete this project, we still need to do the following things.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Complete VTK based parallel visualization} Currently the script loads the data from .pvtu files and prepares them for processing. Now we need to incorporate the VTK filters to prepare the final visualizations.
	\item \textbf{Recreate images/videos generated by ParaView script.} Once the VTK filters are incorporated, we can re-generate all of the images and videos from our old ParaView script and compare the two methods.
	\item \textbf{Finialize both VTK/ Paraview based visualization methods} Both VTK and Paraview based visualization is not entirely complete, we need to do finisialize them properly. 
	% @max : I don't think we might be able to finish below task hence I have commneted that out and added above. 
	%\item \textbf{Combine VTK rendering process with existing C++ code.} Since the inevitable goal of this project is to render the relevant images/videos as the simulation runs, we need to create either a C++ program 
	%to do the rendering or an interface between python and the original C++ simulation. The previous two in-progress items are quick to accomplish but this item will take the majority of our time.
