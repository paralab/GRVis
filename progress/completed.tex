We are currently on schedule for completing our project and haven't run into any major snags. What we have completed up this point are

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{ParaView parallel rendering script.} We can currently render images and video using a parallel ParaView rendering script which we have used to generate a number of visualizations. 
	\item \textbf{VTK Python parallel rendering script.} We have also completed a Python VTK parallel rendering script that can now be used to recreate the visualizations from the ParaView script.
\end{itemize}
